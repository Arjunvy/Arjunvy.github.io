  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a mechanical engineer with a strong foundation in packaging, thermal design, and FEA simulations. With hands-on experience in aerospace and defense projects, I specialize in solving high-complexity thermal and structural challenges in IMUs and high-speed electronics. I focus on creating reliable, production-ready solutions that perform under demanding conditions.

  <h2>Thermal Architecture for High-Power Phased-Array/RADAR/EW/SATCOM Development Platform</h2>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <p>
    Designed the thermal management system for a densely populated 16-layer board dissipating 340W of power. Of this, 200W was concentrated in four critical components, while the remaining heat was spread across numerous devices placed throughout the board.

Due to non-standard package geometries, direct mounting of FanSinks onto the components wasn’t feasible. I developed a board-wide thermal solution involving a large custom heatspreader plate with FanSinks mounted on top. The plate was supported by strategically placed standoffs that made thermal contact with high-power zones on the PCB.

To enable efficient conduction, thermal interfaces were created between the heatspreader plate and the critical components. For components with low junction-to-board thermal resistance, the PCB itself acted as the primary path for heat transfer, conducting heat to the heatspreader touchdowns. This hybrid cooling approach combined direct conduction and forced-air methods to effectively manage heat across the board.

The solution brought junction temperatures of all critical parts well below their maximum rated limits while maintaining form factor and acoustic targets — enabling stable, high-performance operation for phased-array, RADAR, EW, and SATCOM applications.

      The design involved a densely populated PCB, presenting challenges in establishing effective thermal paths. I collaborated extensively with layout and firmware engineers to finalize component placement based on thermal dissipation characteristics.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
      Components with a primary <strong>junction–case–ambient</strong> thermal path were positioned on the top side of the board to enable direct contact with the heatspreader plate. Conversely, components with a <strong>junction–board</strong> thermal path were placed on the bottom side in thermally active zones.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
      These hotspot regions were <strong>strategically arranged</strong> to facilitate efficient insertion of direct thermal touchdowns from the heatspreader plate to the PCB. Placement strategy was validated through thermal simulations to ensure all component junction temperatures remained below their maximum rated thresholds.

      <p><strong>Thermal Management Strategy:</strong><br>
      The first stage of thermal management focused on designing the heatspreader plate and selecting an appropriate FanSink. A 1D thermal resistance network was developed to model the primary thermal path—junction to case—of the critical components. This path was segmented into three slabs:
The top slab represented the junction-to-case thermal resistance,
The middle slab represented the heat source, and copper was selected here due to its low thermal resistance, ensuring efficient heat spreading,
The bottom slab accounted for the thermal resistance from junction to board.
This thermal resistance network was instrumental in calculating the required thermal resistance for the FanSink. Four critical components, collectively dissipating 200W of heat, drove the thermal design. The FanSink was selected based on its thermal performance, footprint compatibility, and fan voltage specifications.
For components where the primary thermal path is junction-to-board, the thermal power was applied as a boundary condition on the corresponding board surface, represented as an outline in the thermal model.
