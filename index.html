  <h2>Thermal Architecture for High-Power Phased-Array/RADAR/EW/SATCOM Development Platform</h2>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <p>
    Designed the thermal management system for a densely populated 16-layer board dissipating 340W of power. Of this, 200W was concentrated in four critical components, while the remaining heat was spread across numerous devices placed throughout the board.

Due to non-standard package geometries, direct mounting of FanSinks onto the components wasn’t feasible. I developed a board-wide thermal solution involving a large custom heatspreader plate with FanSinks mounted on top. The plate was supported by strategically placed standoffs that made thermal contact with high-power zones on the PCB.

To enable efficient conduction, thermal interfaces were created between the heatspreader plate and the critical components. For components with low junction-to-board thermal resistance, the PCB itself acted as the primary path for heat transfer, conducting heat to the heatspreader touchdowns. This hybrid cooling approach combined direct conduction and forced-air methods to effectively manage heat across the board.

The solution brought junction temperatures of all critical parts well below their maximum rated limits while maintaining form factor and acoustic targets — enabling stable, high-performance operation for phased-array, RADAR, EW, and SATCOM applications.

      <p>
        The design involved a densely populated PCB, presenting challenges in establishing effective thermal paths. I collaborated extensively with layout and firmware engineers to finalize component placement based on thermal dissipation characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Components with a primary <strong>junction–case–ambient</strong> thermal path were positioned on the top side of the board to enable direct contact with the heatspreader plate. Conversely, components with a <strong>junction–board</strong> thermal path were placed on the bottom side in thermally active zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        These hotspot regions were <strong>strategically arranged</strong> to facilitate efficient insertion of direct thermal touchdowns from the heatspreader plate to the PCB. Placement strategy was validated through thermal simulations to ensure all component junction temperatures remained below their maximum rated thresholds.

      <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Thermal Management Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        The first stage of thermal management focused on designing the heatspreader plate and selecting an appropriate FanSink. A 1D thermal resistance network was developed to model the primary thermal path—junction to case—of the critical components. This path was segmented into three slabs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top slab:</strong> Junction-to-case thermal resistance</li>
        <li><strong>Middle slab:</strong> Heat source (modeled with copper)</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom slab:</strong> Junction-to-board thermal resistance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This network helped calculate the required thermal resistance for the FanSink. Four critical components, dissipating 200W collectively, drove the design. The FanSink was selected based on thermal performance, footprint, and voltage compatibility.

    <p>
      For components with a junction-to-board path, thermal power was applied as a boundary condition on the board surface. This was represented as an outline in the thermal model, ensuring accurate heat flow representation and robust simulation results.

    <p>
      To improve simulation efficiency, critical components were simplified as thermal slabs for junction-to-case paths, while junction-to-board components were modeled as 2D outlines. This allowed for reduced computational cost and streamlined optimization without sacrificing accuracy.

      <strong>Thermal Simulation Approach and Validation:</strong><br><br>
      Thermal flux for junction-to-case components was applied to the middle slab. For junction-to-board components, flux was applied as surface heat sources. The FanSink interface was also modeled with boundary conditions.<br><br>
      A natural convection coefficient was applied to exposed surfaces. Simulations were run in three stages:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> No thermal management—baseline temperature profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Heatspreader and FanSink added—board hot spots observed.</li>
        <li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Final model with added thermal touchdowns—temperature reduced from ~800°C to ~80°C.</li>
      </ul>
      Real-world validation was conducted using thermocouples at multiple board locations, confirming simulation accuracy.
