  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a mechanical engineer with a strong foundation in packaging, thermal design, and FEA simulations. With hands-on experience in aerospace and defense projects, I specialize in solving high-complexity thermal and structural challenges in IMUs and high-speed electronics. I focus on creating reliable, production-ready solutions that perform under demanding conditions.

  <h2>Thermal Project â€“ High-Speed RF Signal Processing Platform</h2>
  <p>
    I led the thermal architecture design for a high-power, RF-based phased array evaluation system. The challenge was to manage high component-level heat loads while maintaining compact form factors and quiet operation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a full power tree and thermal model using 1D hand calculations.</li>
    <li>Ran CFD and FEA simulations in ANSYS to identify hotspots and airflow bottlenecks.</li>
    <li>Developed a dual-path cooling strategy based on IC packaging (direct sink vs forced air).</li>
    <li>Integrated custom fan-sinks, thermal interface materials, and aluminum heat plates.</li>
    <li>Reduced max component temperatures by 90% through iterative design-validation cycles.</li>
    <li>Final design validated with thermocouple instrumentation and field testing.</li>
  </ul>
