      <h2>Thermal Architecture for High-Power Phased-Array/RADAR/EW/SATCOM Development Platform</h2>

  <!-- Summary -->
  <p>
    Designed the thermal management system for a densely populated 16-layer board dissipating 340W of power. Of this, 200W was concentrated in four critical components, while the remaining heat was spread across numerous devices placed throughout the board.

Due to non-standard package geometries, direct mounting of FanSinks onto the components wasn‚Äôt feasible. I developed a board-wide thermal solution involving a large custom heatspreader plate with FanSinks mounted on top. The plate was supported by strategically placed standoffs that made thermal contact with high-power zones on the PCB.

To enable efficient conduction, thermal interfaces were created between the heatspreader plate and the critical components. For components with low junction-to-board thermal resistance, the PCB itself acted as the primary path for heat transfer, conducting heat to the heatspreader touchdowns. This hybrid cooling approach combined direct conduction and forced-air methods to effectively manage heat across the board.

The solution brought junction temperatures of all critical parts well below their maximum rated limits while maintaining form factor and acoustic targets ‚Äî enabling stable, high-performance operation for phased-array, RADAR, EW, and SATCOM applications.

        Components with a primary <strong>junction‚Äìcase‚Äìambient</strong> thermal path were positioned on the top side of the board to enable direct contact with the heatspreader plate.

        These hotspot regions were <strong>strategically arranged</strong> to facilitate efficient insertion of direct thermal touchdowns from the heatspreader plate to the PCB. Placement strategy was validated through thermal simulations to ensure all component junction temperatures remained below their maximum rated thresholds.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 1200px; margin: auto; padding: 20px;">

  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Thermal Management Strategy</h3>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px;">
    The first stage of thermal management focused on designing the heatspreader plate and selecting an appropriate FanSink. A 1D thermal resistance network was developed to model the primary thermal path‚Äîjunction to case‚Äîof the critical components. This path was segmented into three slabs:
  </p>

  <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
    <img src="Cross section thermal resistance network.png" alt="Thermal Resistance Network" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 8px; color: #555;">

    </p>
  </div>

  <ul style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>The top slab</strong> represented the <em>junction-to-case thermal resistance</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>The middle slab</strong> represented the <em>heat source</em>, and copper was selected here due to its low thermal resistance, ensuring efficient heat spreading.</li>
    <li><strong>The bottom slab</strong> accounted for the <em>thermal resistance from junction to board</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px;">
    This thermal resistance network was instrumental in calculating the required thermal resistance for the FanSink. Four critical components, collectively dissipating 200W of heat, drove the thermal design. The FanSink was selected based on its thermal performance, footprint compatibility, and fan voltage specifications.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px;">
    For components where the primary thermal path is junction-to-board, the thermal power was applied as a boundary condition on the corresponding board surface, represented as an outline in the thermal model. This approach ensured accurate representation of heat flow paths in the simulation, contributing to reliable temperature predictions and robust thermal solution design.

    <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px;">
      To enable efficient simulation, key design simplifications were implemented to reduce computational cost, improve meshing robustness, and streamline parametric and optimization studies. As demonstrated in earlier sections, all components with a primary junction-to-case thermal path were modeled using simplified slab geometries that preserve the critical heat transfer characteristics. In contrast, components with junction-to-board thermal paths were represented as surface outlines on the PCB to capture boundary heat flux without introducing unnecessary model complexity. These simplifications ensured the simulation remained focused on the key thermal physics while maintaining accuracy and scalability.

      Thermal flux for components with a junction-to-case path was applied directly to the middle slab in the simplified model, ensuring accurate heat input at the source. For components with a junction-to-board path, thermal flux was assigned to corresponding surface outlines on the PCB. A dedicated surface was also created on the heatspreader plate to represent the FanSink interface, where thermal flux boundary conditions were applied.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px;">
      To simulate natural heat dissipation, a standard convective heat transfer coefficient was assigned to all exposed surfaces of the heatspreader and PCB. The simulation workflow was executed in three key stages:
    </p>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> A baseline simulation was run without any thermal management to assess natural heat spreading and initial performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> A heatspreader with an attached FanSink was introduced, thermally coupled to key heat sources. This revealed hot spots caused by components with board-dominant thermal paths. Additional thermal contacts ("touchdowns") were added to these areas to improve heat distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Stage:</strong> With complete thermal management in place, simulation results showed a drastic temperature drop‚Äîfrom ~800¬∞C to ~80¬∞C‚Äîfor high-power components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 16px;">
      These simulation results were validated using thermocouple measurements at multiple board locations, confirming both the accuracy of the simulation and the effectiveness of the thermal solution.

    <div class="exp-details" id="exp2">
      Modal Performance & FEA-Based Design Strategy
MEMS sensors are inherently sensitive to vibration due to the presence of an internal moving mass. When the resonant frequency of this moving mass overlaps with the natural frequencies (modal modes) of the sensor package or the PCB, it can result in undesirable interactions‚Äîleading to degraded sensor performance or erroneous outputs.

To mitigate this, we adopt a frequency-aware design approach early in the development cycle:

Frequency Planning During Architecture Phase: Modal analysis is performed during the concept stage using FEA to identify a design architecture that minimizes coupling between the MEMS resonances and the package or board modes. This includes optimizing the sensor placement, package geometry, and mounting method.

Suspended Edge-Mounting: While suspending the PCB along its edges helps isolate the MEMS from package-level vibration modes, it introduces multiple PCB modes of its own. Therefore, we carefully evaluate how these board modes interact with the MEMS.

Parameterization and Optimization: Key design parameters‚Äîsuch as PCB thickness, footprint, and mounting stiffness‚Äîare iteratively adjusted in simulation until we establish a ‚Äúsafe frequency band‚Äù that avoids any overlaps with the MEMS frequency range.

Robustness Across Variations: Since MEMS resonant frequency can vary due to manufacturing tolerances, assembly stresses, and temperature changes, we ensure the modal isolation holds over the full expected variation range.

Prototype Validation: We validate FEA results by building CNC-machined modules and conducting modal tests across temperature ranges to correlate simulations with empirical data.

Legacy Module Improvement: For legacy modules experiencing modal issues, we‚Äôve successfully diagnosed the root causes through in-house test setups and FEA, and implemented package design changes to eliminate the modal coupling‚Äîvalidated by physical testing.

Modal design is a critical aspect of IMU packaging and is often a gatekeeper for product qualification. A robust modal design strategy ensures consistent sensor output across environmental conditions and directly contributes to field reliability.
